\section{DISCUSSION, CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK}\label{Sec:concl}
% Fire outbreaks are a risk to both the fire fighters and victims.
Our current solution provides aide to the fire fighters by identifying victims and alerting their location on the map which should reduce the amount of time taken for the search segment of the search and rescue process. In addition, the robot is also equipped with reducing the volume of dangerous vapours which significantly improves the chances of survival for victims.\\

Although this robot solves a lot of problems currently being faced, there are quite a few drawbacks which could be addressed. Firstly, our robot maybe too big for certain scenarios and as such would be difficult to navigate through smaller passages. Secondly, a fire extinguisher can be placed on top of the robot, which can be actuated when detecting fire around people, to in a way provide minimal fire suppression before the rescue team gets to the fire source, this is not part of the current proposal as it increases the weight added on the robot, which cannot be currently supported on Spot []. Finally, the Spot is currently expensive and with the inclusion of other sensors and actuators to the robot to meet our needs, the cost of design further increases. By using a cheaper and purpose built alternative to the Spot, we would be able to reduce the cost of design.
