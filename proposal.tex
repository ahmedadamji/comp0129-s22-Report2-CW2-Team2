\section{PROPOSAL}\label{Sec:method}
This section introduces the methodology.

\subsection{Sections and subsections}\label{Sec:general}
You can split a section to subsections, and even reference them.  For instance Section~\ref{Sec:intro} is the introduction.  You can also reference the figures.  For instance Fig.~\ref{Fig:universe} is a picture of the universe.  Note that you should upload a figure/picture in the same folder and the main.tex file (using the upload button in the left sidebar).  Also you can add references, which have a special format stored in references.bib file.  To reference a paper you can do in the following way: paper~\cite{Adams1995, Kanoulas2019} talks about the universe.

\subsection{Math}
Math text in $\LaTeX$ are going between dollar signs: $^{0}T_{1}$ is a transformation from frame ${1}$ to frame ${2}$.  The underscore is for subscripts and the hat for superscripts, i.e. $a^2$ and $b_2$.  Also we can include a bit more complex equations in the following way:

\begin{equation}
    ^{0}T_{1} =
    \begin{bmatrix}
    &           & &           \\
    & ^{0}R_{1} & & ^{0}t_{1} \\
    &           & &           \\
    0 & 0 & 0 & 1
    \end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}
